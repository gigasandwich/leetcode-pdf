Single Element in a Sorted Array


You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.



Return the single element that appears only once.



Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]

- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105




-------------------------
Largest Palindrome Product


Given an integer n, return the largest palindromic integer that can be represented as the product of two n-digits integers. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 1337.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 2
Output: 987
Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 1
Output: 9
```







Constraints:

-------------------------
Two Sum


Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.



You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.



You can return the answer in any order.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

-------------------------
Add Two Numbers


You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.



You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.







Example 1:







```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.




-------------------------
Median of Two Sorted Arrays


Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.



The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).







Example 1:




```
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```







Constraints:



- nums1.length == m
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m <= 1000

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```



And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"



Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:




```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N

- s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
- 1 <= numRows <= 1000




-------------------------
Reverse Integer


Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.



Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).







Example 1:




```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```



Example 2:




```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```



Example 3:




```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```







Constraints:



- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
String to Integer (atoi)


Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.



The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:




Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.



Return the integer as the final result.







Example 1:




Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^




Example 2:




Input: s = " -042"
Output: -42
Explanation:

Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^




Example 3:




Input: s = "1337c0d3"
Output: 1337
Explanation:

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^




Example 4:




Input: s = "0-1"
Output: 0
Explanation:

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^




Example 5:




Input: s = "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.







Constraints:



- 0 <= s.length <= 200
- s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.




-------------------------
Palindrome Number


Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.







Example 1:




```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```







Constraints:



- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1






Follow up:
 Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?


-------------------------
Regular Expression Matching


Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:



- '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
- '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.


The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 20
- 1 <= p.length <= 20
- s contains only lowercase English letters.
- p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
- It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.




-------------------------
Container With Most Water


You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).



Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.



Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.



Notice that you may not slant the container.







Example 1:







```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```







Constraints:



- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104




-------------------------
Integer to Roman


Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:






Symbol
Value




I
1


V
5


X
10


L
50


C
100


D
500


M
1000





Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:



- If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
- If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
- Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.


Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.







Example 1:




Input: num = 3749
Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places




Example 2:




Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation:

50 = L
 8 = VIII




Example 3:




Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV








Constraints:



- 1 <= num <= 3999




-------------------------
Roman to Integer


Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.




```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```



For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.



Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:



- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.


Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 15
- s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

3Sum


Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.



Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.


Custom Judge:



The judge will test your solution with the following code:




```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```



If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.




-------------------------
Remove Element


Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.



Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:



- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.


Custom Judge:



The judge will test your solution with the following code:




```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```



If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 100




-------------------------
Divide Two Integers


Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.



The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.



Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.



Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.







Example 1:




```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.
```







Constraints:



- -231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
- divisor != 0




-------------------------
Substring with Concatenation of All Words


You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.



A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.



- For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.


Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.







Example 1:




Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation:
The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.



Example 2:




Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
Explanation:
There is no concatenated substring.



Example 3:




Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
Output: [6,9,12]
Explanation:
The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- 1 <= words.length <= 5000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
- s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.




-------------------------
Next Permutation


A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.



- For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].


The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).



- For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
- Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
- While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.


Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.



The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100




-------------------------
Longest Valid Parentheses


Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

```
Input: s = "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
- s[i] is '(', or ')'.




-------------------------
Search in Rotated Sorted Array


There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).



Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].



Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.



You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Example 3:

- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.



Note:

-------------------------
Count and Say


The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:



- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).


Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string "3322251" we replace "33" with "23", replace "222" with "32", replace "5" with "15" and replace "1" with "11". Thus the compressed string becomes "23321511".



Given a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.







Example 1:




Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = RLE of "1" = "11"
countAndSay(3) = RLE of "11" = "21"
countAndSay(4) = RLE of "21" = "1211"




Example 2:




Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation:
This is the base case.







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 30

-------------------------
Jump Game


You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.



Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105




-------------------------
Merge Intervals


Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.







Example 1:




```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= intervals.length <= 104

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.



Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).



Return intervals after the insertion.



Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.







Example 1:




```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= intervals.length <= 104
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 105

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.



Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.



The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.



The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.







Example 1:







```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:

Formally, a valid number is defined using one of the following definitions:




An integer number followed by an optional exponent.
A decimal number followed by an optional exponent.



An integer number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by digits.



A decimal number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by one of the following definitions:




Digits followed by a dot '.'.
Digits followed by a dot '.' followed by digits.
A dot '.' followed by digits.



An exponent is defined with an exponent notation 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer number.



The digits are defined as one or more digits.







Example 1:




Input: s = "0"
Output: true



Example 2:




Input: s = "e"
Output: false



Example 3:




Input: s = "."
Output: false







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 20
- s consists of only English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), plus '+', minus '-', or dot '.'.




-------------------------
Plus One


You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.



Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.







Example 1:




```
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
```



Example 3:




```
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= digits.length <= 100
- 0 <= digits[i] <= 9
- digits does not contain any leading 0's.




-------------------------
Add Binary


Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.







Example 1:




```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

Example 2:




```

Output: "10101"
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
- a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.




-------------------------
Text Justification


Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.



You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.



Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.



For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.



Note:



- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
- The input array words contains at least one word.






Example 1:




```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= words.length <= 300
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
- 1 <= maxWidth <= 100
- words[i].length <= maxWidth




-------------------------
Sqrt(x)


Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.



You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.



- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.






Example 1:




```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Climbing Stairs


You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.



Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 45




-------------------------
Simplify Path


You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.



The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:



- A single period '.' represents the current directory.
- A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
- Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
- Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.


The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:



- The path must start with a single slash '/'.
- Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
- The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
- The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.


Return the simplified canonical path.







Example 1:




Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation:
The trailing slash should be removed.



Example 2:




Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation:
Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.



Example 3:




Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
Explanation:
A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).



Example 4:




Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation:
Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.



Example 5:




Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
Output: "/.../b/d"
Explanation:
"..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.







Constraints:



- 1 <= path.length <= 3000
- path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
- path is a valid absolute Unix path.

- Replace a character






Example 1:




```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```



Example 2:




```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```







Constraints:

```







Constraints:



- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[0].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- -231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1






Follow up:



- A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?




-------------------------

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:



- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.



You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Minimum Window Substring


Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".



The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```







Constraints:

Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.

-------------------------
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II


Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.



Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.



Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.



Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.



Custom Judge:



The judge will test your solution with the following code:




```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```



If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.




-------------------------
Search in Rotated Sorted Array II


There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).



Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].



Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.



You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
- -104 <= target <= 104






Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- -200 <= x <= 200




-------------------------
Scramble String


We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:




If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.





Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.







Example 1:




```
Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
"great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.
"gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
"gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
"g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
"r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".
"r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "a"
Output: true
```







Constraints:

- 1 <= s1.length <= 30

-------------------------
Merge Sorted Array


You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.



Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.



The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```







Constraints:



- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m, n <= 200
- 1 <= m + n <= 200
- -109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109






Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?





-------------------------

- Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
- The first integer is 0,
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.


Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```



Example 2:




```

Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
```

```

-------------------------
Decode Ways


You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:



"1" -> 'A'
"2" -> 'B'
...
"25" -> 'Y'
"26" -> 'Z'



However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").



For example, "11106" can be decoded into:



- "AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
- "KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
- The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).


Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.



The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.







Example 1:




Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation:
"12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).



Example 2:




Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation:
"226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).



Example 3:




Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation:
"06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06"). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0.







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 100
- s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).




-------------------------
Reverse Linked List II


Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= n <= 500
- -500 <= Node.val <= 500
- 1 <= left <= right <= n

-------------------------
Restore IP Addresses


A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.



- For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.


Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "0000"
Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "101023"
Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 20

-------------------------
Interleaving String


Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.



An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:



- s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
- t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
- |n - m| <= 1
- The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...


Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.







Example 1:







```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
- 0 <= s3.length <= 200
- s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.






Follow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?





-------------------------
Validate Binary Search Tree


Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).



A valid BST is defined as follows:



- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.






Example 1:

Example 1:







```
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```



Example 2:







```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22
```



Example 2:







```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5

  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```



Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.



Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.







Example 1:







```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.







Example 1:




```
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.







Example 1:




```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104




-------------------------
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II


You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.



On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.



Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.







Example 1:




```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104




-------------------------
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.



Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).







Example 1:




```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 105




-------------------------
Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum


A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.



The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.



Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.







Example 1:







```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
- s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
```



Example 2:




```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

- For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.


Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.



A leaf node is a node with no children.







Example 1:







```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```



Example 2:







```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.

- Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
- Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.


To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.







Example 1:




Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation:

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```







Test case format:



For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.



An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.



The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.







Example 1:







```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```



Example 2:







```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
- Node.val is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.

-------------------------
Gas Station


There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].



You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.



Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.







Example 1:




```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```







Constraints:



- n == gas.length == cost.length
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.







Example 1:




```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

- Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.




-------------------------
Copy List with Random Pointer


A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.



Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.



For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.



Return the head of the copied linked list.



The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:



- val: an integer representing Node.val
- random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.


Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.







Example 1:







```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.



There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.



Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.



Implement the LRUCache class:



- LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
- int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.


The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.







Example 1:

lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}

-------------------------
Insertion Sort List


Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.



The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:




Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
It repeats until no input elements remain.



The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.










Example 1:







```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```



Example 2:







```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].

- The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.

Example 1:




```

Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
```



Example 2:




```
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
```



Example 3:




```
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= tokens.length <= 104
- tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].




-------------------------
Reverse Words in a String


Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.



A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.



Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.



Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.






Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?





-------------------------

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.



The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.




-------------------------
Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array


Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:



- [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
- [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.


Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].



Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.



You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- All the integers of nums are unique.
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.




-------------------------
Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II


Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:



- [4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
- [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.


Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].



Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.



You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.






Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?









-------------------------
Min Stack


Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.



Implement the MinStack class:



- MinStack() initializes the stack object.
- void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
- void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
- int top() gets the top element of the stack.
- int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.


You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.







Example 1:




```
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
```







Constraints:



- -231 <= val <= 231 - 1
- Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
- At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.




-------------------------
Intersection of Two Linked Lists


Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.



For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:






The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.



Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.



Custom Judge:



The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):



- intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
- listA - The first linked list.
- listB - The second linked list.
- skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
- skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.


The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.







Example 1:







```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.
```



Example 2:







```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```



Example 3:







```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
- The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
- 1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105
- 0 <= skipA <= m
- 0 <= skipB <= n
- intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
- intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.






Follow up:
 Could you write a solution that runs in 
``O(m + n)``
 time and use only 
``O(1)``
 memory?


-------------------------
Find Peak Element


A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.



Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.



You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.



You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
- nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.




-------------------------
Maximum Gap


Given an integer array nums, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two elements, return 0.



You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 109




-------------------------
Compare Version Numbers


Given two version strings, version1 and version2, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots '.'. The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.



To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as 0.



Return the following:



- If version1 < version2, return -1.
- If version1 > version2, return 1.
- Otherwise, return 0.






Example 1:




Input: version1 = "1.2", version2 = "1.10"
Output: -1
Explanation:
version1's second revision is "2" and version2's second revision is "10": 2 < 10, so version1 < version2.



Example 2:




Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".



Example 3:




Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation:
version1 has less revisions, which means every missing revision are treated as "0".







Constraints:



- 1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
- version1 and version2 only contain digits and '.'.

Binary Search Tree Iterator


Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):



- BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
- boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
- int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.


Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.



You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.







Example 1:







```
Input
["BSTIterator", "next", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
[[[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false]

Explanation
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator([7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]);
bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 9
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 15
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 20
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False

Dungeon Game


The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.



The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.



Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).



To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.



Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.



Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.







Example 1:







```
Input: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

-------------------------
Reverse Bits


Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.



Note:



- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.






Example 1:




```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100

Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.

Example 1:




```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]

House Robber II


You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.



Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

The Skyline Problem


A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.



The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:



- lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
- righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
- heighti is the height of the ith building.


You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.



The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.



Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]







Example 1:







```
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= buildings.length <= 104
- 0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1
- 1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1
- buildings is sorted by lefti in non-decreasing order.

```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], indexDiff = 2, valueDiff = 3
Output: false
Explanation: After trying all the possible pairs (i, j), we cannot satisfy the three conditions, so we return false.

Example 1:




```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

-------------------------
First Bad Version


You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.



Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.



You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```



Example 2:

Example 1:




```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

Peeking Iterator


Design an iterator that supports the peek operation on an existing iterator in addition to the hasNext and the next operations.



Implement the PeekingIterator class:



- PeekingIterator(Iterator<int> nums) Initializes the object with the given integer iterator iterator.
- int next() Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
- boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still elements in the array.
- int peek() Returns the next element in the array without moving the pointer.


Note: Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and Iterator, but they all support the int next() and boolean hasNext() functions.







Example 1:




```
Input
["PeekingIterator", "next", "peek", "next", "next", "hasNext"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false]

Explanation
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator([1, 2, 3]); // [1,2,3]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move [1,2,3].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element [1,2,3]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False
```

-------------------------
Game of Life


According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."



The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):




Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.



The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.



Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.



Note that you do not need to return anything.







Example 1:







```
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```



Example 2:







```
Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
```







Constraints:



- m == board.length
- n == board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 25
- board[i][j] is 0 or 1.






Follow up:



- Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
- In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?




-------------------------
Word Pattern


Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.



Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:



- Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
- Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
- No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.






Example 1:




Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Explanation:
The bijection can be established as:

'a' maps to "dog".
'b' maps to "cat".




Example 2:




Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false



Example 3:




Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false







Constraints:



- 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
- pattern contains only lower-case English letters.

-------------------------
Find Median from Data Stream


The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.



- For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
- For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.


Implement the MedianFinder class:



- MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
- void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
- double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
```







Constraints:



- -105 <= num <= 105
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.

Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree


Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.



Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.



Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.







Example 1:







```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

-------------------------
Bulls and Cows


You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.



You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:



- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.


Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.



The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.







Example 1:




```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```



Example 2:




```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000
- secret.length == guess.length
- secret and guess consist of digits only.

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

- NumArray(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- int sumRange(int left, int right) Returns the sum of the elements of nums between indices left and right inclusive (i.e. nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]).






Example 1:

numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 = 1
numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -1
numArray.sumRange(0, 5); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -3
```

Given a 2D matrix matrix, handle multiple queries of the following type:



- Calculate the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).


Implement the NumMatrix class:



- NumMatrix(int[][] matrix) Initializes the object with the integer matrix matrix.
- int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2) Returns the sum of the elements of matrix inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).


You must design an algorithm where sumRegion works on O(1) time complexity.







Example 1:







```
Input
["NumMatrix", "sumRegion", "sumRegion", "sumRegion"]
[[[[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]], [2, 1, 4, 3], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 4]]
Output
[null, 8, 11, 12]

Explanation
NumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix([[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]);
numMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3); // return 8 (i.e sum of the red rectangle)
numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2); // return 11 (i.e sum of the green rectangle)
numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4); // return 12 (i.e sum of the blue rectangle)
```

Additive Number


An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence.



A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.



Given a string containing only digits, return true if it is an additive number or false otherwise.



Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.







Example 1:




```
Input: "112358"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
```



Example 2:




```
Input: "199100199"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
```

```
Input
["NumArray", "sumRange", "update", "sumRange"]
[[[1, 3, 5]], [0, 2], [1, 2], [0, 2]]
Output
[null, 9, null, 8]

Explanation
NumArray numArray = new NumArray([1, 3, 5]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
numArray.update(1, 2);   // nums = [1, 2, 5]
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).


Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).







Example 1:




```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```



Example 2:




```

-------------------------
Minimum Height Trees


A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.



Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).



Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.



The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.







Example 1:







```

Burst Balloons


You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.



If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.



Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19].
```



Example 2:




```

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.







Example 1:







```
Input: n = 3

After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.

Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree


One way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.






For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where '#' represents a null node.



Given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.



It is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.



You may assume that the input format is always valid.



- For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as "1,,3".


Note: You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.







Example 1:




```
Input: preorder = "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Output: true

Reconstruct Itinerary


You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.



All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.



- For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].


You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.







Example 1:







```
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]

-------------------------
Flatten Nested List Iterator


You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.



Implement the NestedIterator class:



- NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
- int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
- boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.


Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:




```
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []
while iterator.hasNext()
    append iterator.next() to the end of res
return res
```



If res matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.







Example 1:




```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nestedList.length <= 500
- The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-106, 106].

Explanation
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
twitter.postTweet(1, 5); // User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5]. return [5]
twitter.follow(1, 2);    // User 1 follows user 2.

- Fill either jug completely with water.
- Completely empty either jug.
- Pour water from one jug into another until the receiving jug is full, or the transferring jug is empty.






Example 1:




Input:   x = 3, y = 5, target = 4 
Output:   true 
Explanation:
Follow these steps to reach a total of 4 liters:

Fill the 5-liter jug (0, 5).
Pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, leaving 2 liters (3, 2).
Empty the 3-liter jug (0, 2).
Transfer the 2 liters from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug (2, 0).
Fill the 5-liter jug again (2, 5).
Pour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full. This leaves 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (3, 4).
Empty the 3-liter jug. Now, you have exactly 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (0, 4).

Reference: The Die Hard example.

Guess Number Higher or Lower


We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:



I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.



Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.



You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:



- -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
- 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).


Return the number that I picked.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```



Example 3:

-------------------------
Guess Number Higher or Lower II


We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:




I pick a number between 1 and n.
You guess a number.
If you guess the right number, you win the game.
If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.



Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.







Example 1:







```
Input: n = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
    - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.
- Guess 1.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.
    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.
The worst case is that you pay $1.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 200




-------------------------
Wiggle Subsequence


A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.



- For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
- In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.


A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.



Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
```

Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
```







Constraints:

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.



You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).







Example 1:




```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
```



Example 2:




```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5
```







Constraints:



- n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- -109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109

Implement the RandomizedSet class:



- RandomizedSet() Initializes the RandomizedSet object.
- bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
- bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
- int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.


You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in average O(1) time complexity.







Example 1:

[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]

Explanation
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.
```







Constraints:



- -231 <= val <= 231 - 1
- At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to insert, remove, and getRandom.
- There will be at least one element in the data structure when getRandom is called.

Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed


RandomizedCollection is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element.



Implement the RandomizedCollection class:



- RandomizedCollection() Initializes the empty RandomizedCollection object.
- bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise.
- bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
- int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains.


You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average O(1) time complexity.



Note: The test cases are generated such that getRandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the RandomizedCollection.







Example 1:




```
Input
["RandomizedCollection", "insert", "insert", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [1], [2], [], [1], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, 1]

Explanation
RandomizedCollection randomizedCollection = new RandomizedCollection();
randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return true since the collection does not contain 1.
                                  // Inserts 1 into the collection.
randomizedCollection.insert(1);   // return false since the collection contains 1.
                                  // Inserts another 1 into the collection. Collection now contains [1,1].
randomizedCollection.insert(2);   // return true since the collection does not contain 2.
                                  // Inserts 2 into the collection. Collection now contains [1,1,2].
randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should:
                                  // - return 1 with probability 2/3, or
                                  // - return 2 with probability 1/3.
randomizedCollection.remove(1);   // return true since the collection contains 1.
                                  // Removes 1 from the collection. Collection now contains [1,2].
randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should return 1 or 2, both equally likely.
```







Constraints:



- -231 <= val <= 231 - 1
- At most 2 * 105 calls in total will be made to insert, remove, and getRandom.
- There will be at least one element in the data structure when getRandom is called.




-------------------------
Linked List Random Node


Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.



Implement the Solution class:



- Solution(ListNode head) Initializes the object with the head of the singly-linked list head.
- int getRandom() Chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. All the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be chosen.






Example 1:







```
Input
["Solution", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.getRandom(); // return 1
solution.getRandom(); // return 3
solution.getRandom(); // return 2
solution.getRandom(); // return 2
solution.getRandom(); // return 3
// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the linked list will be in the range [1, 104].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.



Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.







Example 1:




```
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
```

Example 2:




```
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"

```







Constraints:



- 1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 105
- ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters.




-------------------------
Shuffle an Array


Given an integer array nums, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. All permutations of the array should be equally likely as a result of the shuffling.



Implement the Solution class:



- Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- int[] reset() Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
- int[] shuffle() Returns a random shuffling of the array.






Example 1:




```
Input
["Solution", "shuffle", "reset", "shuffle"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.shuffle();    // Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result.
                       // Any permutation of [1,2,3] must be equally likely to be returned.
                       // Example: return [3, 1, 2]
solution.reset();      // Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3]. Return [1, 2, 3]
solution.shuffle();    // Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3]. Example: return [1, 3, 2]
```

- All the elements of nums are unique.
- At most 104 calls in total will be made to reset and shuffle.




-------------------------
Mini Parser


Given a string s represents the serialization of a nested list, implement a parser to deserialize it and return the deserialized NestedInteger.



Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "324"
Output: 324
Explanation: You should return a NestedInteger object which contains a single integer 324.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "[123,[456,[789]]]"
Output: [123,[456,[789]]]
Explanation: Return a NestedInteger object containing a nested list with 2 elements:
1. An integer containing value 123.
2. A nested list containing two elements:
    i.  An integer containing value 456.
    ii. A nested list with one element:
         a. An integer containing value 789
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of digits, square brackets "[]", negative sign '-', and commas ','.
- s is the serialization of valid NestedInteger.
- All the values in the input are in the range [-106, 106].




-------------------------
Lexicographical Numbers


Given an integer n, return all the numbers in the range [1, n] sorted in lexicographical order.



You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 13
Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

Example 2:




```

Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104




-------------------------
First Unique Character in a String


Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.







Example 1:




Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation:
The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.



Example 2:




Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2



Example 3:




Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.




-------------------------
Longest Absolute File Path


Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:







Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.



In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):




```
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
```



If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.



Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.



Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.



Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.







Example 1:







```
Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.
```



Example 2:







```
Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
"dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21
"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: input = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named "a".
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= input.length <= 104
- input may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character '\n', a tab character '\t', a dot '.', a space ' ', and digits.
- All file and directory names have positive length.




-------------------------
Find the Difference


You are given two strings s and t.



String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.



Return the letter that was added to t.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.




-------------------------
Elimination Game


You have a list arr of all integers in the range [1, n] sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm on arr:



- Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
- Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
- Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.


Given the integer n, return the last number that remains in arr.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 9
Output: 6
Explanation:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
arr = [2, 6]
arr = [6]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 109




-------------------------
Perfect Rectangle


Given an array rectangles where rectangles[i] = [xi, yi, ai, bi] represents an axis-aligned rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is (xi, yi) and the top-right point of it is (ai, bi).



Return true if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.







Example 1:







```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4],[1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.
```



Example 2:







```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,2,3],[1,3,2,4],[3,1,4,2],[3,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.
```



Example 3:







```
Input: rectangles = [[1,1,3,3],[3,1,4,2],[1,3,2,4],[2,2,4,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 104
- rectangles[i].length == 4
- -105 <= xi < ai <= 105
- -105 <= yi < bi <= 105




-------------------------
Is Subsequence


Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.



A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

Example 2:




```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 104
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.






Follow up:
 Suppose there are lots of incoming 
``s``
, say 
``s1, s2, ..., sk``
 where 
``k >= 109``
, and you want to check one by one to see if 
``t``
 has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?


-------------------------
UTF-8 Validation


Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).



A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:




For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.



This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:




```
Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```



x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.



Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.







Example 1:




```
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= data.length <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= data[i] <= 255




-------------------------
Decode String


Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.



The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.



You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].



The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 30
- s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'.
- s is guaranteed to be a valid input.
- All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].




-------------------------
Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters


Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.



if no such substring exists, return 0.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= k <= 105




-------------------------
Rotate Function


You are given an integer array nums of length n.



Assume arrk to be an array obtained by rotating nums by k positions clock-wise. We define the rotation function F on nums as follow:



- F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].


Return the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).



The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,6]
Output: 26
Explanation:
F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26
So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [100]
Output: 0
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 105
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100




-------------------------
Integer Replacement


Given a positive integer n, you can apply one of the following operations:




If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.



Return the minimum number of operations needed for n to become 1.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```



Example 3:




```
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Random Pick Index


Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.



Implement the Solution class:



- Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.
- int pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.






Example 1:




```
Input
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]
Output
[null, 4, 0, 2]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(1); // It should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
- target is an integer from nums.
- At most 104 calls will be made to pick.




-------------------------
Evaluate Division


You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.



You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.



Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.



Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.



Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.







Example 1:




```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? 
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
note: x is undefined => -1.0
```



Example 2:




```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```



Example 3:




```
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

-------------------------
Nth Digit


Given an integer n, return the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...].







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Binary Watch


A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.



- For example, the below binary watch reads "4:51".






Given an integer turnedOn which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on (ignoring the PM), return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in any order.



The hour must not contain a leading zero.



- For example, "01:00" is not valid. It should be "1:00".


The minute must consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.



- For example, "10:2" is not valid. It should be "10:02".






Example 1:




```
Input: turnedOn = 1
Output: ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
```

Example 2:




```

Frog Jump


A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.



Given a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.



If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.







Example 1:




```
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

```



Example 2:




```
Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.



You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.







Example 1:







```
Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [8,0,7]
```



Example 3:




```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.






Follow up: Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?





-------------------------
Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence


Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.



A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.



- For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
- For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.


A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.



- For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].


The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
```







Constraints:



- 1  <= nums.length <= 1000
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Number of Boomerangs


You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).



Return the number of boomerangs.







Example 1:




```
Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 2
```



Example 3:




```
Input: points = [[1,1]]
Output: 0
```







Constraints:



- n == points.length
- 1 <= n <= 500
- points[i].length == 2
- -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
- All the points are unique.




-------------------------
Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array


Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
```

Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= n






Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.





-------------------------
Serialize and Deserialize BST


Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.



Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.



The encoded string should be as compact as possible.







Example 1:




```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

Example 2:




```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 104
- The input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.




-------------------------
Delete Node in a BST


Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.



Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:




Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.







Example 1:







```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105
- Each node has a unique value.
- root is a valid binary search tree.
- -105 <= key <= 105






Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?





-------------------------
Sort Characters By Frequency


Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.



Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
- s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.




-------------------------
Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons


There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.



Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.



Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.







Example 1:




```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= points.length <= 105
- points[i].length == 2
- -231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements


Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.



In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.




-------------------------
4Sum II


Given four integer arrays nums1, nums2, nums3, and nums4 all of length n, return the number of tuples (i, j, k, l) such that:



- 0 <= i, j, k, l < n
- nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0






Example 1:




```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [-2,-1], nums3 = [-1,2], nums4 = [0,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> nums1[0] + nums2[0] + nums3[0] + nums4[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> nums1[1] + nums2[1] + nums3[0] + nums4[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums1 = [0], nums2 = [0], nums3 = [0], nums4 = [0]
Output: 1
```







Constraints:



- n == nums1.length
- n == nums2.length
- n == nums3.length
- n == nums4.length
- 1 <= n <= 200
- -228 <= nums1[i], nums2[i], nums3[i], nums4[i] <= 228




-------------------------
Assign Cookies


Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.



Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.







Example 1:




```
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
- 0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
- 1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1

132 Pattern


Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].



Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109




-------------------------
Repeated Substring Pattern


Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```



Example 3:




```
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of lowercase English letters.




-------------------------
LFU Cache


Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.



Implement the LFUCache class:



- LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
- int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
- void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.


To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.



When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.



The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.







Example 1:




```
Input
["LFUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x
// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)
LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);
lfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1
lfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1
lfu.get(1);      // return 1
                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2
lfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3
lfu.get(4);      // return 4
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= capacity <= 104
- 0 <= key <= 105
- 0 <= value <= 109
- At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.

       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.



Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,10,2,9]
Output: 16
```







Constraints:



- n == nums.length
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109




-------------------------
Island Perimeter


You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.



Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).



The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.







Example 1:







```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
```



Example 2:

```



Example 3:




```
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4
```







Constraints:



- row == grid.length
- col == grid[i].length
- 1 <= row, col <= 100
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
- There is exactly one island in grid.




-------------------------
Can I Win


In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.



What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?



For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.



Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.







Example 1:




```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true
```



Example 3:




```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20
- 0 <= desiredTotal <= 300




-------------------------
Count The Repetitions


We define str = [s, n] as the string str which consists of the string s concatenated n times.



- For example, str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc".


We define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1.



- For example, s1 = "abc" can be obtained from s2 = "abdbec" based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.


You are given two strings s1 and s2 and two integers n1 and n2. You have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].



Return the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.







Example 1:




```
Input: s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2
Output: 2

- s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= n1, n2 <= 106




-------------------------
Unique Substrings in Wraparound String


We define the string base to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so base will look like this:



- "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".


Given a string s, return the number of unique non-empty substrings of s are present in base.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the substring "a" of s is in base.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "cac"
Output: 2

-------------------------
Validate IP Address


Given a string queryIP, return "IPv4" if IP is a valid IPv4 address, "IPv6" if IP is a valid IPv6 address or "Neither" if IP is not a correct IP of any type.



A valid IPv4 address is an IP in the form "x1.x2.x3.x4" where 0 <= xi <= 255 and xi cannot contain leading zeros. For example, "192.168.1.1" and "192.168.1.0" are valid IPv4 addresses while "192.168.01.1", "192.168.1.00", and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IPv4 addresses.



A valid IPv6 address is an IP in the form "x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8" where:



- 1 <= xi.length <= 4
- xi is a hexadecimal string which may contain digits, lowercase English letter ('a' to 'f') and upper-case English letters ('A' to 'F').
- Leading zeros are allowed in xi.


For example, "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" and "2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334" are valid IPv6 addresses, while "2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:037j:7334" and "02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" are invalid IPv6 addresses.







Example 1:




```
Input: queryIP = "172.16.254.1"
Output: "IPv4"
Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".
```



Example 2:




```
Input: queryIP = "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"
Output: "IPv6"
Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".
```



Example 3:




```
Input: queryIP = "256.256.256.256"
Output: "Neither"
Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.
```







Constraints:



- queryIP consists only of English letters, digits and the characters '.' and ':'.




-------------------------
Concatenated Words


Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.



A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.







Example 1:




```
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```



Example 2:




```
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= words.length <= 104
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
- words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of words are unique.
- 1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105




-------------------------
Matchsticks to Square


You are given an integer array matchsticks where matchsticks[i] is the length of the ith matchstick. You want to use all the matchsticks to make one square. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.



Return true if you can make this square and false otherwise.







Example 1:







```
Input: matchsticks = [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: matchsticks = [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= matchsticks.length <= 15
- 1 <= matchsticks[i] <= 108




-------------------------
Ones and Zeroes


You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.



Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.



A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.







Example 1:




```
Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= strs.length <= 600
- 1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
- 1 <= m, n <= 100




-------------------------
Heaters


Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.



Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.



Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.



Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.







Example 1:




```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heaters were placed at positions 1 and 4. We need to use a radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 104
- 1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 109




-------------------------
Number Complement


The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.



- For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.


Given an integer num, return its complement.







Example 1:




```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= num < 231






Note: This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/





-------------------------
Total Hamming Distance


The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.



Given an integer array nums, return the sum of Hamming distances between all the pairs of the integers in nums.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [4,14,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case).
The answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [4,14,4]
Output: 4
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 109
- The answer for the given input will fit in a 32-bit integer.




-------------------------
Sliding Window Median


The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle values.



- For examples, if arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
- For examples, if arr = [1,2,3,4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.


You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. There is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.



Return the median array for each window in the original array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,5.00000,6.00000]
Explanation: 
Window position                Median
---------------                -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7        1
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1

 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7        3
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7        5
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]       6
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,1,4,2], k = 3
Output: [2.00000,3.00000,3.00000,3.00000,2.00000,3.00000,2.00000]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Magical String


A magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:



- The string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.


The first few elements of s is s = "1221121221221121122……". If we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be "1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are "1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......". You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.



Given an integer n, return the number of 1's in the first n number in the magical string s.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s is "122112" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= n <= 105




-------------------------
License Key Formatting


You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.



We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.



Return the reformatted license key.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
- 1 <= k <= 104




-------------------------
Smallest Good Base


Given an integer n represented as a string, return the smallest good base of n.



We call k >= 2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1's.







Example 1:




```
Input: n = "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: n = "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: n = "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.
```







Constraints:



- n is an integer in the range [3, 1018].
- n does not contain any leading zeros.




-------------------------
Max Consecutive Ones


Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.




-------------------------
Predict the Winner


You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.



Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.



Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 20
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 107




-------------------------
Zuma Game


You are playing a variation of the game Zuma.



In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.



Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:



- Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
- If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.
	
If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
- If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
- If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
- Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.


Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.







Example 1:




```
Input: board = "WRRBBW", hand = "RB"
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: board = "WWRRBBWW", hand = "WRBRW"
Output: 2
Explanation: To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: board = "G", hand = "GGGGG"
Output: 2
Explanation: To make the board empty:
- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GG.
- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GGG. GGG -> empty.
2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= board.length <= 16
- 1 <= hand.length <= 5
- board and hand consist of the characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'.
- The initial row of balls on the board will not have any groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.




-------------------------
Construct the Rectangle


A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:




The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.



Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.







Example 1:




```
Input: area = 4
Output: [2,2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]
```



Example 3:




```
Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= area <= 107




-------------------------
Reverse Pairs


Given an integer array nums, return the number of reverse pairs in the array.



A reverse pair is a pair (i, j) where:



- 0 <= i < j < nums.length and
- nums[i] > 2 * nums[j].






Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The reverse pairs are:
(1, 4) --> nums[1] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
(3, 4) --> nums[3] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,5,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The reverse pairs are:
(1, 4) --> nums[1] = 4, nums[4] = 1, 4 > 2 * 1
(2, 4) --> nums[2] = 3, nums[4] = 1, 3 > 2 * 1
(3, 4) --> nums[3] = 5, nums[4] = 1, 5 > 2 * 1
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1




-------------------------
Target Sum


You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.



You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.



- For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression "+2-1".


Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1], target = 1
Output: 1
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 20
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- 0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000
- -1000 <= target <= 1000




-------------------------
Teemo Attacking


Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.



You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.



Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.







Example 1:




```
Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= timeSeries.length <= 104
- 0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 107
- timeSeries is sorted in non-decreasing order.




-------------------------
Next Greater Element I


The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.



You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.



For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.



Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
- All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.

-------------------------
Keyboard Row


Given an array of strings words, return the words that can be typed using letters of the alphabet on only one row of American keyboard like the image below.



Note that the strings are case-insensitive, both lowercased and uppercased of the same letter are treated as if they are at the same row.



In the American keyboard:



- the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",
- the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and
- the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm".









Example 1:




Input: words = ["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]
Output: ["Alaska","Dad"]
Explanation:
Both "a" and "A" are in the 2nd row of the American keyboard due to case insensitivity.



Example 2:




Input: words = ["omk"]
Output: []



Example 3:




Input: words = ["adsdf","sfd"]
Output: ["adsdf","sfd"]







Constraints:



- 1 <= words.length <= 20

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.



If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.



Assume a BST is defined as follows:



- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.






Example 1:







```
Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]
```



Example 2:




```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```







Constraints:



- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

Follow up:
 Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).


-------------------------
IPO


Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.



You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.



Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.



Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.



The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.







Example 1:




```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= k <= 105
- 0 <= w <= 109
- n == profits.length
- n == capital.length
- 1 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= profits[i] <= 104
- 0 <= capital[i] <= 109




-------------------------
Next Greater Element II


Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.



The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.







Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

-------------------------
Relative Ranks


You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.



The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:



- The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
- The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
- The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
- For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").


Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.







Example 1:




```
Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
```



Example 2:




```
Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.



Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false.







Example 1:




```
Input: num = 28
Output: true
Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

```







Constraints:



- 1 <= num <= 108




-------------------------
Most Frequent Subtree Sum


Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.



The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).







Example 1:







```
Input: root = [5,2,-3]
Output: [2,-3,4]
```



Example 2:







```
Input: root = [5,2,-5]
Output: [2]
```

-------------------------
Freedom Trail


In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring" and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.



Given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword.



Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the "12:00" direction. You should spell all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the "12:00" direction and then by pressing the center button.



At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:




You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the "12:00" direction, where this character must equal key[i].
If the character key[i] has been aligned at the "12:00" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.







Example 1:







```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "godding"
Output: 13
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100
- ring and key consist of only lower case English letters.

Output: 3
Explanation:
1st move:    1     0 <-- 5    =>    1     1     4
2nd move:    1 <-- 1 <-- 4    =>    2     1     3
3rd move:    2     1 <-- 3    =>    2     2     2
```



Example 2:

Explanation:
1st move:    0 <-- 3     0    =>    1     2     0
2nd move:    1     2 --> 0    =>    1     1     1
```



Example 3:




```

Longest Uncommon Subsequence I


Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If no such uncommon subsequence exists, return -1.



An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of exactly one of them.







Example 1:




```
Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".
```



Example 3:




```
Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. So the answer would be -1.
```

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.



- For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).






Example 1:




```
Input: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]

A good subarray is a subarray where:



- its length is at least two, and
- the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of k.


Note that:



- A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
- An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.






Example 1:




```
Input: nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42.
42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 13
Output: false
```







Constraints:

The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1
```

License Key Formatting


You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.



We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.



Return the reformatted license key.







Example 1:

⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
```



If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.



Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.



Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.



Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.







Example 1:







```
Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is "dir/subdir2/file.ext" of length 20.
```



Example 2:







```
Input: input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
"dir/subdir1/file1.ext" of length 21
"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext" of length 32.
We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.
```



Example 3:




```
Input: input = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named "a".
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= input.length <= 104
- input may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character '\n', a tab character '\t', a dot '.', a space ' ', and digits.
- All file and directory names have positive length.

Encode and Decode TinyURL


Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.


TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.



There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.



Implement the Solution class:



- Solution() Initializes the object of the system.
- String encode(String longUrl) Returns a tiny URL for the given longUrl.
- String decode(String shortUrl) Returns the original long URL for the given shortUrl. It is guaranteed that the given shortUrl was encoded by the same object.






Example 1:




```
Input: url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Output: "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"

Explanation:
Solution obj = new Solution();
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after decoding it.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= url.length <= 104
- url is guranteed to be a valid URL.




-------------------------
Poor Pigs


There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.



You can feed the pigs according to these steps:




Choose some live pigs to feed.
For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
Repeat this process until you run out of time.



Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.







Example 1:




```
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.
```



Example 2:




```
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:
- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.
At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= buckets <= 1000
- 1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100




-------------------------
Minimum Genetic Mutation


A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.



Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string startGene to a gene string endGene where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.



- For example, "AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA" is one mutation.


There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank to make it a valid gene string.



Given the two gene strings startGene and endGene and the gene bank bank, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to endGene. If there is no such a mutation, return -1.



Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.







Example 1:




```
Input: startGene = "AACCGGTT", endGene = "AACCGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA"]
Output: 1
```



Example 2:




```
Input: startGene = "AACCGGTT", endGene = "AAACGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA","AACCGCTA","AAACGGTA"]
Output: 2
```







Constraints:



- 0 <= bank.length <= 10
- startGene.length == endGene.length == bank[i].length == 8
- startGene, endGene, and bank[i] consist of only the characters ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'].




-------------------------
LFU Cache


Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.



Implement the LFUCache class:



- LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
- int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
- void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.


To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.



When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.



The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.







Example 1:




```
Input
["LFUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x
// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)
LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);
lfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1
lfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1
lfu.get(1);      // return 1
                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2
lfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3
lfu.get(4);      // return 4
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= capacity <= 104
- 0 <= key <= 105
- 0 <= value <= 109
- At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.






 


-------------------------

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.







Example 1:




```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```



Example 2:




```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```







Constraints:



- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.
